Why Python?

    Simplicity: Python allows rapid development with clear, concise code.
    Parsing Ease: Tools like ply (Python Lex-Yacc) or lark make building parsers and interpreters straightforward.
    Rich standard library for handling strings, collections, and I/O operations, crucial for interpreter implementations.

Libraries/Tools:

    ply: A simple lex/yacc implementation, great for quick parser and lexer generation.
    lark: Easy-to-use, declarative parsing framework.

Use Case:

    Quick prototyping, experimenting with language features, or educational projects.
